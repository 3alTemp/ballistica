The Ballistica project is the foundation for the next generation of [BombSquad](http://bombsquadgame.com). It will be debuting with the upcoming 1.5 release of the game and lays the foundation for some of the big changes coming in 2.0.

### Project Goals
* Provide modders and tinkerers with the same tools and development environment that I am using
  * I've spent 
* Improve transparency so people can more easily see what parts of the game I am working on at any given time

### Frequently Asked Questions
* **Q: What's with the new name? Is BombSquad getting renamed?**
* A: No, BombSquad is not getting renamed. 'Ballistica' is simply the name for the engine tech now. This way it can be used for other game/app projects without causing confusion. As a modder, the biggest change is that you will see a lot of 'ba' prefixes in the APIs as opposed to 'bs'.

* **Q: Does this mean BombSquad is open source?**
* A: Yes and no. All code contained in this repo is MIT licensed and free for use anywhere. This includes game scripts, pipeline tools, etc. In the future I hope to expand this to include at least some binary sources. Anything not included here, however, even if automatically downloaded by build scripts, is still copyrighted and cannot be redistributed without explicit consent. This includes assets and game binaries. So in general: create and share mods to your heart's content, but please don't distribute your own complete copy of the game.  Please email support@froemling.net if you have any questions.
