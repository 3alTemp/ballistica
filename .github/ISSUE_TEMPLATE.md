## Important info and some tips
- Ensure your issue isn't a duplicate. Agree, you will get an answer to your question faster if you find it yourself.
- Write a good, understable issue description. Try to write so that you don't have to ask again. due to the difference in time zones, the problem may not be resolved until a few days later.
- You can mention other issue/PR (e.g. #1).
- Hyperlinks are very useful.
- If you want to paste logs/code please put it into \`\`\`, so much easier to perceive. For example:
```python
def hello():
    print("**Hello, Markdown!**")
```
