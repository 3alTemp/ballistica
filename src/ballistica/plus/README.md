# Plus Feature Set

Bits of the engine related to accounts and cloud functionality. In prefab builds
the compiled code for this feature set is contained in the pre-compiled static
ballisticakit_internal library. The plus feature set can also be removed from
spinoff projects if desired to remove the need for that library.
